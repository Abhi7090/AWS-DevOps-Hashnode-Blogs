What is Ansible :

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and more. It simplifies the process of managing and orchestrating infrastructure by allowing you to define tasks and configurations in a declarative manner.

Here are two key concepts in Ansible: Ansible and Ansible Playbooks.

1. **Ansible:**
    
    * Ansible is the automation engine or framework.
        
    * It uses SSH to connect to remote servers and execute tasks.
        
    * It is agentless, meaning you don't need to install any software on the managed nodes (servers you want to automate).
        
2. **Ansible Playbooks:**
    
    * Playbooks are written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) and define a set of tasks to be executed.
        
    * They describe the desired state of the system.
        
    * Playbooks can be used for tasks such as configuring servers, installing software, and more.
        
    * Playbooks consist of one or more plays, and each play contains a set of tasks.
        
3. How to Install ansible in ubuntu
    
    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
    
    sudo apt update
    
    sudo apt install ansible
    
4. How to play around ansible in ubuntu
    
    1. Create 4 instances namely : Master server(Instance 1), Host 1(Instance 2), Host 2(Instance 3), Host 3(Insatnce 4)
        
    2. Open CMD, goto folder where your keypair downloaded while creating keypair and copy SSH from EC2 Instance
        
    3. Create directory name keypair, in this directory we need to push our private key to remote machine using ssp
        
        scp -i "yourkeypair" filename ec2-user@publicIPaddress:/home/ubuntu/keys
        
    4. Create hosts servers in vim editor
        
        sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts
        
        \[servers\]
        
        host\_1 ansible\_host=public\_IP\_Host1
        
        host\_2 ansible\_host=public\_IP\_Host2
        
        host\_3 ansible\_host=public\_IP\_Host3
        
        \[all:vars\]
        
        ansible\_python\_interpreter=/user/bin/python3
        
        ansible\_user=ubuntu
        
        ansible\_ssh\_private\_key\_file=/home/ubuntu/keys/keypairname.pem
        
    5. Now check servers are up
        
        ansible -m ping servers
        
        ansible -a "free -h" servers
        
        ansible -a "uptime"servers
        
    6. if any one of the host server is not up then run following command
        
        ansible -a "sudo apt update" servers
        
    7. Ansible Playbook :
        
        An Ansible playbook is a configuration file written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) that defines a set of tasks, configurations, and plays to be executed by Ansible. Playbooks are the primary building blocks for defining automation workflows in Ansible. They allow you to describe the desired state of a system and the steps needed to achieve that state.
        
        create an vim playbook.yml

    8. Deployed Nginx application using ansible playbook
        
        Create vim nginx\_app.yml and vim index.html
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1703436685028/8b165992-1db7-4f22-916e-c0ab26aa494c.png align="center")

        After creating yml file, now run the following command
        
        ansible-playbook nginx\_app.yml
